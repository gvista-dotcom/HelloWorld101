HelloWorld101
A simple “Hello, World!” project built with Java, Python, and Streamlit — created to mark a fresh new chapter in my journey back into coding.

🚀 About This Project
HelloWorld101 is my way of restarting my learning path after being away from programming for several years.
This project may be simple, but for me, it represents dedication, consistency, and growth.
I’m using this space to relearn the fundamentals, explore new tools, and rebuild my confidence as a developer.

📚 My Learning Journey
It took me some time to get everything set up, but I’m learning step by step with the help of AI and online resources.
Years ago, Canada Learning Code reintroduced me to web programming and design at a basic level. Life took me in different directions, and I wasn’t able to fully continue at that time — but now I’m returning with a stronger desire to learn and grow.

👩‍💼 Professional Background
I have worked in the government sector, the private sector, and have volunteered with non-profit organizations. Throughout these experiences, I’ve collaborated with people from diverse backgrounds, which strengthened my communication, adaptability, and teamwork skills.
Now, I’m looking for an opportunity where I can learn on the job, grow with a supportive team, and contribute meaningfully. I’m motivated, curious, and ready to build new skills in tech.
